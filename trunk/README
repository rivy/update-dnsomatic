#                        update-dnsomatic
#
# Perl script which updates DNS-O-Matic with your current IP address.
# Inspired from original code posted on the OpenDNS forum here...
# <http://forums.opendns.com/comments.php?DiscussionID=1135>
# 
# ... and hacked about by prawn: sean dot prawn at gmail dot com
# to specifically work with DNS-0-Matic.
#
# Overview:  Program visits http://myip.dnsomatic.com/ to get your IP
#            address.  If it has changed, it will perfom a web update
#            on the DNS-O-Matic site and store your new IP address in 
#            /etc/update-dnsomatic/myip.  Results are logged in 
#            the syslog.
#
#  Installing:  Edit the file config with at least your DNS-O-Matic
#               user id and password.  You may want to assign myhost
#               with your domain name if you only wish to update that
#               item.
#
#  As root or sudo:
#    
#  ./install.sh
#
# As far as I am aware the Modules used in this code are distributed 
# with Perl.
